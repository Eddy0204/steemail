# Steemail - The Future of Email
Imagine sending email through the blockchain in a secure way. You will not be vulnerable to hacks as we offer 2 layer encryption and an extra bonus protection of matching to encryption to the text. It will be virtually impossible as a hacker will need to hack you, us, and go through the whole steam blockchain in order to find your message.
## How it works
Instead of using tradition email servers messages will just be sent through the steem blockchain. This makes the emails always archivable so if there is a problem with our servers you still will be able to read your emails.
## How is this secure?
This is a very good question, and it took me a while to find the answer. All of your messages sent through steamail are encrypted and can only be decrypted by a code sent by a traditional email server along with the message sent through the blockchain. In the client, it will automatically be decrypted if you have the code, the messages, and are signed in to the account that the message was sent to.
